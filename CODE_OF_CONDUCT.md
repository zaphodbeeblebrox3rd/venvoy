# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Scientific Integrity**: Maintaining high standards of reproducibility and transparency in computational research
* **Collaborative Spirit**: Working together to solve complex problems in scientific computing and data analysis
* **Inclusive Communication**: Using welcoming and inclusive language that respects diverse perspectives
* **Constructive Feedback**: Providing helpful, specific feedback that improves the project and helps others learn
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Sharing expertise and helping others understand scientific computing concepts
* **Respectful Disagreement**: Accepting constructive criticism and engaging in respectful debate about technical decisions
* **Empathy**: Showing empathy towards other community members, especially those new to scientific computing
* **Professional Conduct**: Maintaining professional standards appropriate for academic and research environments

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* **Scientific Misconduct**: Falsifying data, misrepresenting results, or undermining reproducibility standards
* **Exclusionary Behavior**: Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests
* **Unprofessional Communication**: Using language that is not appropriate for academic or research environments

## Scientific Computing Community Guidelines

As a project focused on scientific reproducibility, we have additional expectations:

* **Reproducibility First**: Prioritize solutions that enhance scientific reproducibility and transparency
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consider the diverse computing environments used in scientific research
* **Documentation Standards**: Maintain clear documentation that enables others to reproduce your work
* **Version Control**: Use proper versioning and change tracking for scientific computing environments
* **Testing and Validation**: Ensure changes maintain the integrity of scientific computing workflows
* **Accessibility**: Consider the needs of researchers with different technical backgrounds and computing resources

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [zaphodbeeblebrox3rd@users.noreply.github.com](mailto:zaphodbeeblebrox3rd@users.noreply.github.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Scientific Research Context

This project serves the scientific research community, where reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration are fundamental values. We expect all contributors to:

* **Maintain Scientific Standards**: Ensure that all contributions support the goal of scientific reproducibility
* **Respect Research Ethics**: Follow ethical guidelines appropriate for scientific computing and data analysis
* **Support Open Science**: Contribute to the broader goal of making scientific computing more accessible and reproducible
* **Consider Global Impact**: Remember that this tool may be used in critical research across different cultures and contexts

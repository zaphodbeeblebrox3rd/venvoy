# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

venvoy is committed to maintaining the security and integrity of scientific computing environments. As a tool that creates containerized Python and R environments for research reproducibility, security is paramount to protect both the tool itself and the research environments it creates.

## 🚨 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Container Security
- **Base Image Security**: We use official, regularly updated base images
- **Package Integrity**: All packages are verified through official repositories
- **Runtime Isolation**: Containers provide process and filesystem isolation
- **User Privileges**: Containers run with non-root users when possible

### Scientific Computing Security
- **Data Protection**: Research data remains on the host system
- **Environment Isolation**: Each venvoy environment is isolated from others
- **Reproducibility Integrity**: Ensures scientific results are not compromised
- **Cross-Platform Safety**: Maintains security across different operating systems

### HPC Environment Security
- **No Root Access**: Works with Apptainer/Singularity without requiring root privileges
- **Cluster Compatibility**: Designed for secure execution on shared computing resources
- **User Isolation**: Maintains user separation on multi-user systems

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**Email**: [zaphodbeeblebrox3rd@users.noreply.github.com](mailto:zaphodbeeblebrox3rd@users.noreply.github.com)

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Steps to reproduce the issue (if possible)
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions of venvoy are affected
5. **Environment Details**: 
   - Operating system and version
   - Container runtime (Docker, Apptainer, Singularity, Podman)
   - Python/R versions
   - Architecture (x86_64, ARM64, etc.)
6. **Potential Fix**: Any suggestions for fixing the issue (optional)

### Example Report

```
Subject: Security Vulnerability Report - venvoy

Description:
A potential privilege escalation vulnerability in the container user mapping
functionality that could allow unauthorized access to host filesystem.

Impact:
An attacker could potentially access files outside the intended container
workspace, compromising research data or system security.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Create a venvoy environment with specific user mapping
2. Mount a sensitive directory
3. [Additional steps...]

Affected Versions:
- venvoy 0.1.0
- venvoy 0.1.1

Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Container Runtime: Docker 24.0.0
- Architecture: x86_64
```

## 🔄 Response Process

### Timeline

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and will respond according to the following timeline:

1. **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
2. **Assessment**: Within 7 days to assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities
4. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### Response Steps

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and its impact
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We will release a security update
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure

### Communication

- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will work with you to verify the fix
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep venvoy Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Verify Downloads**: Use official installation methods
3. **Secure Environments**: Don't run untrusted code in venvoy environments
4. **Data Protection**: Be cautious with sensitive research data
5. **Network Security**: Use secure networks when downloading packages

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
2. **Container Security**: Follow container security best practices
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in the development process

## 🔍 Security Audit

### Regular Security Practices

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of Python and system dependencies
- **Container Image Updates**: Regular updates of base container images
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review for all changes
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing of the tool

### Security Tools

We use the following tools and practices:

- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Docker Security Scanning**: Container image vulnerability scanning
- **Code Review**: Manual security review of all changes

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for security reporting:

- **Social Engineering**: Attacks requiring social engineering
- **Physical Access**: Attacks requiring physical access to systems
- **Third-Party Services**: Vulnerabilities in third-party services we use
- **Denial of Service**: DoS attacks that don't compromise data
- **Information Disclosure**: Disclosure of non-sensitive information
